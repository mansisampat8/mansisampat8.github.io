Before you build, know if your idea has real space to win.

**Focus:** Customer Pulse

- Live consumer sessions to reveal why people buy—or don’t
- Identify trust signals and pricing triggers that unlock traction
- Shape your pitch around what your audience actually cares about

**Founder’s Edge Promise:**  
Hear the truth straight from your customers, not your gut.
