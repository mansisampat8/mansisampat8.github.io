       I work with founders who want growth without the waste. If you’re building a startup in Mumbai or anywhere in India, you already know how fast budgets vanish on ads, experiments, and “trial and error.” My job is to cut through that noise.<br><br>
        After completing my Bachelor's in Mass Media (Advertising), I pursued a Law degree, followed by a Master’s in English Literature.My lens is multi-disciplinary; law, literature, advertising, and five years of high-level research. This mix lets me see both the structure and the story of your business: where the market is headed, how your competitors win, and what your customers actually care about.<br><br>
        I turn that into actionable growth strategies that save you time, money, and frustration. Think of it as your shortcut to sharper decisions and faster growth.<br><br>
        At Consumer Kanvas, I design and lead our Founder’s Edge Reports and Customer Conversion Labs; giving founders a clear map of their market, unfiltered customer truths, and a growth playbook that translates directly into sales.I don’t do jargon. I do clarity, action, and results.<br><br>

       I’ve worked with 300+ winning brands and over 500 women-led startups — and if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: building a business is about far more than revenue. For founders, it’s also about identity, self-worth, and freedom.<br><br>
        <strong>My mission is simple</strong><br>
        to help women create businesses they love, and earn money they truly own. Because, as I always say: “The taste of your own money is the sweetest.”<br>
        As she says, “The taste of your own money is the sweetest.”<br><br>
        I started my journey with nothing but a laptop and a burning drive. Along the way, I’ve trained over 2,500 women entrepreneurs and mentored 1,000+ business ideas. I know first-hand the mistakes, formulas, and breakthroughs that shape a founder’s path and I bring that real-world insight and empathy into every strategy I build with you.<br><br>
        As Co-Founder of Consumer Kanvas, I focus on brand building with heart and practicality — turning ideas into strategies that work in the real world.<br><br>
        In 2016, I was invited to Delhi for the launch of Start-Up India, Stand-Up India recognized among 2,000 entrepreneurs shaping India’s future. But at the end of the day, I still see myself as a small business owner first.<br><br>
        I’ve walked the same road you’re walking. My role is to make your journey lighter, faster, and more rewarding.<br><br>
