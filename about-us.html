      <div class="founder-bio">
        I’ve always believed that bold ideas deserve rigorous validation. With a career built at the intersection of law, literature, advertising, and consumer behavior, I bring a rare multi-disciplinary lens to business strategy.<br><br>
        After completing my Bachelor's in Mass Media (Advertising), I pursued a Law degree, followed by a Master’s in English Literature each layer refining how I read people, patterns, and the stories that move them. Five years in legal research at a leading LPO honed my investigative precision and cross-industry analysis.<br><br>
        But my true calling was always in understanding why people buy, what they believe, and how brands can speak to that truth.<br><br>
        At Consumer Kanvas, I specialize in qualitative research, FGDs (focus group discussions), and IDIs (in-depth interviews) to uncover what most brands overlook: real consumer voice. Whether it’s a founder exploring product-market fit or a scaling brand refining their GTM, I help decode market signals into sharp strategy.<br><br>
        If you’re looking for a thinking partner who brings empathy, logic, and clarity to every business decision, you’re in the right place.
