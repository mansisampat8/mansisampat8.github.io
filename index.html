    <h2>Founders Ask Us…</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>“I already know my customer. Do I still need this?”</h3>
      <p>Many Indian startup founders think they know their ideal customer until skyrocketing Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) reveal otherwise. Wasted ad spend and inaccurate targeting quietly drain marketing budgets and hurt profitability. The Founder’s Edge System tests your assumptions with real customer insights, helping startups reduce CAC, reach high-intent audiences, and scale sales without burning money on ads that don’t convert.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>“Is the money spent worth it for my stage?”</h3>
      <p>Most startups waste 5–10L on wrong ads. This system prevents that. It pays back before your next campaign.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>“How do I know if my product-market fit is strong?”</h3>
      <p>We measure fit using live customer feedback, competitor analysis, and your funnel’s performance. The Founder’s Edge System reveals whether your startup resonates with buyers and highlights exactly what tweaks will drive faster adoption in India.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">

      <p>Absolutely. By mapping your real target audience, testing offers, and refining messaging, our system ensures campaigns on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Google reach high-intent buyers reducing CAC and increasing ROI.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
